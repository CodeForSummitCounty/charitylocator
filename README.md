# Charity Locator

## Project Summary

To provide a convenient way for anyone to locate a charity (501c3) closest to them.

## Background

irs.gov provides a search for tax-exempt organizations here:

    <http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&-Non-Profits/Exempt-Organizations-Select-Check>

The data for this is provided to general public here:

    http://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/forwardToPub78Download.do

It is the goal of this project to:
* Map the charities for which street addresses are easily discovered
* Provide an easy way to allow end users to tag charities, to also increase discoverability
* If possible, use apis from google or microsoft to provide directions to the charity's location

## Project Moderator's personal comments

I am @gsvolt. I believe that everyone deserves to know which charities are in my surrounding area. In fact, I'd like to know about any charities around me where-ever I travel - atleast in USA.

I have realized pretty quickly that such a resource does not exist and is merited.
